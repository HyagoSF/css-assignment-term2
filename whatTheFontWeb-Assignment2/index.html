    <div class="lyric">
        <div class="">
            <p>
                We passed upon the stair
                We spoke of was and when
                Although I wasn't there
                He said I was his friend
                Which came as some surprise
                I spoke into his eyes
                "I thought you died alone
                A long, long time ago"
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="afraid">Oh no, not me</span>
                I never lost control
                You're face to face
                With the man who sold the world

                I laughed and shook his hand
                And made my way back home
                I searched for form and land
                For years and years, I roamed
                I gazed a gazely stare
                At all the millions here
                We must have died alone
                A long, long time ago
            </p>

            <p>
                Who knows? <span class="afraid">Not me</span>
                We never lost control
                You're face to face
                With the man who sold the world
                Who knows? Not me
                We never lost control
                You're face to face
                With the man who sold the world
            </p>
